# Weather_Data_Analysis

This is an analysis that I did using the real time data by using weather and google API's. It was great working on this and learnt a lot on API data from reading documentations to implementation. The weather data was collected randomly from 600 cities and various plots with respect to temperature, humidity, wind speed and cloudiness has been plotted. The relationship with respect to latitude was analyzed. 

As the next step the data collected from weather API was converted to CSV and gmaps was used to plot the humidity as a heat map. The screenshot is attached. The google API was used to find hotels and plot them as markers on the heat map.

# getting started

The WeatherPy jupyter notebook has the analysis done using weather API.
The VacationPy jupyetr notebook has the analysis with google maps and API requests.

# note
 1. Please use your own API keys by putting them in the api_keys.py.
 2. The csv is saved in resources folder in the name cities_weather_data and the path is './Resources/cities_weather_data.csv'
